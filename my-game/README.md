Hello !
It's my first project that combines the things I have learned in a recent year.
To open my project first enter it and get it on your computer using GitHub.
After getting it on your pc open the inner folder with:
"cd my-game"
and then use 
npm start if you have the package manager downloaded.
Have fun exploring :D !
